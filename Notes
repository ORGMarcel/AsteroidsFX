Notes for the project.

Achieving stable interfaces is still a challenge in CBSE because it's difficult to cover a larger basis of principles for further implementation.

For a contract, an interface isn't enough. Pre- and post conditions also need to be defined.

Clean architecture.

Layered component based architecture
- Improve maintainability
- Each business component consists of a necessary business object and a DAO for persistence
- Further partitioning of 3-layered architecture.

Dependency injection and Service locator model are two different ways to code around glue code classes.
